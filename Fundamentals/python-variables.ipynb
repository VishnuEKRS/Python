    "# Python Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** In this tutorial, you’ll learn about Python variables and how to use them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Variable in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you develop a program, you need to manage values, a lot of them. To store values, you use variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. And a variable is always associated with a value. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "\n",
    "message = 'Good Bye!'\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "Good Bye!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `message` is a variable. It holds the string 'Hello, World!'. The `print()` function shows the message 'Hello, World!' to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line assigns the string 'Good Bye!' to the `message` variable and prints its value to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `message` can hold various values at different times, and its value can change throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a variable, you use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `=` is the assignment operator. In this syntax, you assign a value to the `variable_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value can be anything like a number, a string, etc., that you assign to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following defines a variable named `counter` and assigns the number 1 to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "counter = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When you name a variable, you need to adhere to some rules. If you don’t, you’ll get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the variable rules that you should keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (_). They can start with a letter or an underscore (_), not with a number.\n",
    "- Variable names cannot contain spaces. To separate words in variables, you use underscores, for example, `sorted_list`.\n",
    "- Variable names cannot be the same as keywords, reserved words, and built-in functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following guidelines help you define good variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable names should be concise and descriptive. For example, the `active_user` variable is more descriptive than `au`.\n",
    "- Use underscores (_) to separate multiple words in the variable names.\n",
    "- Avoid using the letter `l` and the uppercase letter `O` because they look like the number 1 and 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable is a label that you can assign a value to it. The value of a variable can change throughout the program.\n",
    "- Use the `variable_name = value` to create a variable.\n",
    "- The variable names should be as concise and descriptive as possible. Also, they should adhere to Python variable naming rules.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Python Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about Python numbers and how to use them in programs. Python supports integers, floats, and complex numbers. This tutorial discusses only integers and floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "The integers are numbers such as -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3, and they have type `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Math operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` to form expressions that include integers. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 20 + 10\n",
    "30\n",
    ">>> 20 - 10\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>> 20 * 10\n",
    "200\n",
    ">>> 20 / 10\n",
    "2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate exponents, you use two multiplication symbols (`**`). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 3**3\n",
    "27\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify the order of operations, you use the parentheses `()`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 20 / (10 + 10)\n",
    "1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "Any number with a decimal point is a floating-point number. The term float means that the decimal point can appear at any position in a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you can use floats like integers. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 0.5 + 0.5\n",
    "1.0\n",
    ">>> 0.5 - 0.5\n",
    "0.0\n",
    ">>> 0.5 / 0.5\n",
    "1.0\n",
    ">>> 0.5 * 0.5\n",
    "0.25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The division of two integers always returns a float:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 20 / 10\n",
    "2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you mix an integer and a float in any arithmetic operation, the result is a float:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 1 + 2.0\n",
    "3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the internal representation of floats, Python will try to represent the result as precisely as possible. However, you may get a result that you would not expect. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 0.1 + 0.2\n",
    "0.30000000000000004\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just keep this in mind when you perform calculations with floats. You'll learn how to handle situations like this in later tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Underscores in Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "When a number is large, it'll become difficult to read. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 10000000000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make long numbers more readable, you can group digits using underscores, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 10_000_000_000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When storing these values, Python ignores the underscores. It also does so when displaying the numbers with underscores on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 10_000_000_000\n",
    "print(count)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "10000000000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The underscores also work for both integers and floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the underscores in numbers have been available since Python 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python supports common numeric types, including integers, floats, and complex numbers.\n",
    "- Use underscores to group numbers for large numbers."
